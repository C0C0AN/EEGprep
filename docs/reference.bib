	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/{EEG}) measure the weak electromagnetic signals originating from neural currents in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate brain activity is a challenging task, as evidenced by several decades of methodological contributions. {MNE}, whose name stems from its capability to compute cortically-constrained minimum-norm current estimates from M/{EEG} data, is a software package that provides comprehensive analysis tools and workflows including preprocessing, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. The present paper gives detailed information about the {MNE} package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential caveats in analysis. The {MNE} package is a collaborative effort of multiple institutes striving to implement and share best methods and to facilitate distribution of analysis pipelines to advance reproducibility of research.

	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/{EEG}) measure the weakelectromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using thesesignals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is achallenge that requires expertise in physics, signalprocessing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the {MNE} softwaresuite, {MNE}-Python is an open-sourcesoftware package that addresses this challenge by providingstate-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation offunctional connectivity between distributed brain regions.All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/{EEG} data analysispipelines by writing Python scripts.Moreover, {MNE}-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientificcomptutation (Numpy, Scipy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as wellas the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new {BSD} licenseallowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although {MNE}-Python has onlybeen under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved withexpanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices.{MNE}-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets,helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility ofmethods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens ofexamples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

	abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional {MRI} and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that {MRI} is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}), a standard for organizing and describing {MRI} datasets. The {BIDS} standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

	abstract = {The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}). The portability of these applications ({BIDS} Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. {BIDS} Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the {BIDS} standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. {BIDS} Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use {BIDS} Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.},
